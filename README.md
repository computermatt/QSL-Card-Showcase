QSL Card Showcase
=================

Tentative name for a project I'm doing in my free time to show off QSL cards received
by the Rochester Institute of Technology Amateur Radio Club, K2GXT.

In the future I plan on creating a full web interface along with analytic tools and also an API
to allow people to take their digitized QSL cards and view them easily.

More documentation on how to use this program as well as updates to it to make it easier for everybody
to use is coming soon.

As of right now this code is provided AS IS.
